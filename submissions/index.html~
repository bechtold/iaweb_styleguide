<h1 class="page-heading">Showcase Submissions</h1>

<div id="main">
 

<p>
Since UX Day Graz is a community event, we would like you to
participate. Either as individuals or in small groups, we would like
you to briefly introduce yourselves and what you do, by presenting in
the Community Showcase session.
</p>


<h2>Showcase Presentations</h2>

<p>
We would like each person or small group to put together a five-minute
presentation (a showcase presentation) of themselves and what they do
in user experience (UX), interaction design, or usability.
</p>


<p>
By "small group" we mean:
</p>
<ul>
<li>an individual</li>
<li>a small group of work colleagues</li>
<li>a small research group</li>
<li>a small collection of individuals collaborating say on a project</li>
</ul>



<p>
The presentation should follow this structure:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Who we are? (name(s) and affiliations)</li>
<li>What we do? (UX philosophy at company/research group)</li>
<li>Short Example of a UX Project:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial situation</li>
    <li>Interesting or new approaches</li>
    <li>Pitfalls</li>
    <li>Message and findings</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<p>
The idea is that everyone gets to know everyone else and something
about what they do.
</p>





<h2>Showcase Submissions</h2>


<p>
Please prepare and submit your showcase video or presentation as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<li>

Prepare your presentation or video in a commonly used format (with a
commonly used presentation tool or codec).
</p>

If, for some reason, we cannot play your presentation or video, we may
have to ask you to convert it to a different format.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The presentation should be maximum five minutes long.
</p>

<p>
with details about your presentation.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
Your submission will be retrieved and reviewed.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Showcase Session places will be allocated to reflect a balanced
selection of topics and groups, the quality of submissions, and the
order of receipt of submissions.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
The showcase presentations will be recorded and the video recordings
later placed on the UX Day Graz 2015 web site.  By submitting a
showcase presentation, you give your permission for us to record and
publish your presentation.
</p>

at the discretion of the organisers.
