  talktitle: A Designer’s Guide to Empathy
  abstract: |
    <p>
    We spend more time in our browsers than in bed and more
    time with our smartphones than with our families. Computing and
    digital user interfaces are now woven into the fabric of everyday life.
    As designers, we are no longer just tampering with people's productivity,
    we are handling the worlds most precious resource: attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk examines the challenges of building empathy with a global
    audience. It takes a critical look at how design decisions shape our
    everyday lives and at our role as mediators between the interests of
    users and businesses.

    <p>
    I design things. I create meaningful experiences. I understand the
    importance of the narrative arc, which allows me to take my team, my
    clients, and my customers - our heroes - on a journey that is both
    rewarding and inspirational. I embrace the vagaries of cause and
    effect, desire and gratification. I know how to tell a good story.
    </p>

    <p>
    I cut my design teeth creating new digital products for Thompson
    Reuters in New York City. After jumping the pond for a masters in film
    theory, I was one of the lead designers of the YouView (nee Canvas)
    IPTV platform for the BBC and its partner broadcasters. In 2009 I
    joined LBi, where clients have included Virgin Atlantic, BT, and
    Cunard. I am currently one of the acting heads of the LBi user
    experience design team.

    <p>
    In my spare time I write fiction and dabble in film production.

    <p>
    As the co-head of a team of 40 UX designers, I help to create and
    drive our department’s vision and guiding principles. I ensure quality
    work, increase efficiencies, pitch new business, foster mentorship,
    improve career development, and recruit some of the best talent
    around. I educate the business on the role of user experience as a
    professional service, and I represent LBi externally at conferences
    and through a growing relationship with the IPA.
