    In this talk, Eric will show how to improve the user experience
    of websites, especially for people with disabilities. He will also
    introduce the various W3C resources that help getting started with
    accessibility, implementing them and describe why it makes sense for
    everyone to let everyone have a good experience.

    Eric Eggert is currently working for W3C’s Web Accessibility
    Initiative. He first got into contact with accessibility while
    promoting standards-based web design in the early 2000s. In 2006, he
    moved to Vienna, Austria where he continued to work freelance and also
    got in touch with the accessibility community there. In 2011 he also
    co-founded the small 2-person web design and consulting studio

  talktitle: A Designer’s Guide to Empathy
  abstract: |
    <p>
    We spend more time in our browsers than in bed and more
    time with our smartphones than with our families. Computing and
    digital user interfaces are now woven into the fabric of everyday life.
    As designers, we are no longer just tampering with people's productivity,
    we are handling the worlds most precious resource: attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk examines the challenges of building empathy with a global
    audience. It takes a critical look at how design decisions shape our
    everyday lives and at our role as mediators between the interests of
    users and businesses.

  talktitle: Visual Search and Analysis
  abstract: |
    <p>
    In this talk, I will discuss selected approaches for visual search
    and analysis in large textual and non-textual document
    collections. First, recent techniques for visual analysis of
    sentiment and opinion properties in large amounts of textual
    documents, including promising application possibilities, will be
    discussed. Then, I will focus on visual support for information
    retrieval in non-textual documents, in particular multimedia and
    time-oriented research data. I argue that new visual-interactive
    approaches can provide for effective user access to large document
    corpora, including discovering of interesting relationships
    between data items. I will conclude with some research
    opportunities at the intersection of visualization, information
    retrieval, and evaluation.
