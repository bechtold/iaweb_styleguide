  talktitle: A Designer’s Guide to Empathy
  abstract: |
    <p>
    We spend more time in our browsers than in bed and more
    time with our smartphones than with our families. Computing and
    digital user interfaces are now woven into the fabric of everyday life.
    As designers, we are no longer just tampering with people's productivity,
    we are handling the worlds most precious resource: attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    This talk examines the challenges of building empathy with a global
    audience. It takes a critical look at how design decisions shape our
    everyday lives and at our role as mediators between the interests of
    users and businesses.
